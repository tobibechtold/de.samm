SAMM
=======
The goal is to develop management software which allows the user to manage all of his TV Shows and movies. 
The software scans the user’s hard drive for TV shows and Movies and catalogues them. Information about the 
shows is fetched from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The shows and movies are represented with cover photos, 
rating and a little plot. Additionally TV Shows are displayed in seasons and their respective episodes as for 
example a Tree View.
